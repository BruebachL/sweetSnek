        **A high interactive SMB and RDP Honeypot with Nmap OS Obfuscation**
        
        *Author: Lukas Brübach lukas.bruebach@student.fhws.de*
        
        Description: This software is intended to be run on a Linux Server. When deployed, it presents itself as the operating
        system defined in template when scanned with Nmap. It also exposes emulated SMB and RDP protocols. Actions are logged and
        forwarded to a central collection point.
        
        Prerequisites:
        
        - Linux (tested with Arch/Ubuntu 20.10)
        - Python 3.10+
        - python-nfqueue=0.6 (apt install python-nfqueue python-libnetfilter python3.10 python3.10-dev python3.10-venv [possibly additional python3 packages]) 
        - requirements.txt
        
        Recorded logs are stored to `/root/sweetSnek/osfingerprinting/example.log`
        
        Usage:
        
            python3.10 os_obfuscation.py
                --template path to the nmap fingerprint, either absolute or relative to the execution folder  the iptables to access over ssh. the ssh port should either be changed to 63712 or the port number in stack_packet/helper.py
                --public_ip either fetches the server public ip or gets the ip set for the interface 
                --interface the network interface
                --debug debugging output
        
        **Note: This script flushes iptables before and after usage!**
        
        # Installation
        
        ## Ubuntu
        
        Ubuntu 20.04 does not ship with Python 3.10.
        To install Python 3.10, first install the required dependency for adding custom PPAs.
        
            sudo apt install software-properties-common -y
        
        Then add the deadsnakes PPA to the APT package manager sources list.
        
            sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa
        
        Now you may install python3.10 (note that all calls WILL be to 'python3.10 OPTIONS' not 'python3 OPTIONS')
        
            sudo apt install python3.10
        
        ## Arch
        
        Python 3.10 is available in the official arch repo and aliased as 'python3'. Lucky us.
        
            sudo pacman -S python310
        
        ## Virtual Environment
        
        You are strongly encouraged to create a virtual environment for this project. To do so, type:
        
            python3.10 -m venv env
        
        afterwards activate the environment with
        
            source env/bin/activate
        
        This ensures a clean slate for dependency management through the pip package manager.
        
        ## Installing Python Module dependencies with pip
        
        Navigate to the project root (/root/sweetSnek/) and issue
        
            python3.10 -m pip install -e .
        
        This should install any required dependencies listed in requirements.txt and setup.py (the requirements listed in both should be identical).
        This is required for each fresh virtual environment. In most cases, only one virtual environment needs to be created.
